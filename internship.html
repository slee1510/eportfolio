              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">During my time in Singapore, I was given the opportunity to work with MinerLabs, a technology company that specializes in developing advanced industrial and aerospace applications. Their focus was a collaborative project with a local flight school to enhance the student pilots’ learning experiences through the use of flight simulators. The main task we were assigned to complete during our time here was to redesign the evaluation dashboard website, which displayed flight assessment stats through various graphs, allowing students and instructors to analyze what had gone well and what they could improve on in their flight.</p>

            <div class="home-body" style="background-color: rgba(80, 81, 85, 0.6); max-width: 800px">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">With my data science focus, I was initially tasked with controlling the flow of data from the database to the dashboard display, ensuring proper access and displays for the user as needed. After I completed this, I went beyond my initial expectations and began to learn more about UI/UX design and how to construct the website. Working with my co-intern, whose focus was the UI/UX aspect, I’ve been able to learn a lot about website design and how to implement different features. Overall, with this task, we were given free rein in terms of how we wanted the design to look and what we wanted the layout of the site to be. Our bosses manage the administrative tasks, such as contract work, leaving the website responsibilities to the interns. Our assignments mainly support the project’s mission and enhance the experience our partners have with our program.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">In the goal-setting assignment, most of my goals revolved around learning new technical skills and developing professional soft skills. I was able to meet these goals during my time at MinerLabs by actively engaging in my project and seeing it through, from creating the website framework to achieving live, responsive deployment. Additionally, I strengthened my communication and presentation skills while collaborating with my team to bring our project to life and providing regular updates to our supervisors during meetings. Overall, this experience helped me achieve my goals and build confidence while working in a professional environment, providing a strong foundation for continued growth and skill refinement.</p>
