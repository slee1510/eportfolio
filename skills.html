            <h3>Data Analytics & Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>I assisted in developing scripts to extract data points from a cloud-based database and automated the data rendering into our project dashboard with interactive charts and graphs through the Chart.js library. I also learned to properly identify and prioritize key metrics needed for user analysis out of a large selection of variables.</p>

            <h3>UI/UX Design</h3>
            <p>In my internship, I was given the chance to explore some basics of frontend development this summer. I created my first Figma design for our project’s website framework and learned basic HTML and CSS syntax to help prototype my design. I also gained some exposure to Javascript, Next.js, and React.</p>

            <h3>Communication & Presentation</h3>
            <p>I strengthened my communication and presentation skills by regularly updating my team and supervisors on our project’s progress. We were given the opportunity to pitch our ideas and critiques, present and explain technical concepts, and confidently respond to feedback and questions.</p>
