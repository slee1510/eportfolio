              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; max-width: 800px">Being in Singapore for 8 weeks gave me plenty of time to explore a lot of different parts of Singaporean culture. While I was able to see many of the well-known, touristy spots of Singapore, I was also eager to explore the everyday aspects of local life in the daily routine I adapted. The immense diversity of this country could be seen everywhere, from the local Hawker centers with endless stalls and such a wide range of cuisines to the various religious temples respectfully coexisting next to each other. The harmony within the community is also strong, reflected in the orderly public transport and the care for the environment. Despite being extremely developed, there were a surprising amount of green areas in Singapore, from botanical gardens to hiking trails. This balance really spoke to the peaceful, harmonious atmosphere in Singapore, which was one of my favorite aspects of its culture.</p>

          <div class="about-me-container" style="word-spacing: 2px; line-height: 1.6; max-width: 1200px">
            <div class="home-body" style="background-color: rgba(80, 81, 85, 0.6); max-width: 800px">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">One of the most challenging things about studying and working abroad is adjusting to the cultural differences. In my workplace, the polychronic and relationship-oriented culture was very prominent. While we still managed to complete our tasks promptly, I had noticed that there wasn’t a huge emphasis on timelines to follow, with lots of room for flexibility. I was more used to having strict deadlines and more guidance than I was given, which was something I had to adapt to. Instead of relying on my supervisors to provide deadlines and directions unprompted, I asked them questions whenever I needed any clarifications or wanted more specific instructions. Although English is one of the official languages of Singapore, not all locals I met were very fluent. Having this small language barrier was sometimes a challenge since it wasn’t easy to communicate, but it has motivated me to hopefully learn some conversational Mandarin in the future.</p>

            <div class="home-body" style="background-color: rgba(80, 81, 85, 0.6); max-width: 800px">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">Despite these challenges, I was able to learn a lot from my experience abroad. For one, I learned how to be adaptable, whether it was adjusting to new communication styles in the workplace or exploring different cultural norms in everyday life. Being in a new place with unfamiliar expectations and environments teaches you to be more open-minded with your interactions and intentions. Being able to observe your surroundings and adjust accordingly is an important lesson I learned that helped me navigate my new surroundings and situations with confidence and approach challenges with a flexible mindset. I also learned the value of staying present in the moment. I enjoyed planning my weekend excursions with friends and meticulously managing our timing, but I found it equally enjoyable to explore new neighborhoods with no timeline or agenda. It allowed me to take in my surroundings and appreciate the small, everyday moments that made this entire experience extremely meaningful.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">Now, I hope to use this intercultural experience to apply the skills I gained abroad to become more flexible and open-minded, whether it’s around campus or in my future workplace. Living in such a multicultural society has taught me how to thrive in environments outside of my comfort zone. I’ve developed stronger communication skills and learned how to better think on my feet in unfamiliar situations. All of these lessons and experiences have helped to shape me into someone who can collaborate well within diverse teams and approach challenges with a global perspective.</p>
