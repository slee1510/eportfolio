               <p class="singapore-description-text">During the summer of 2022 I had the fantastic opportunity to do a month long public health study abroad program in Costa Rica. The program was associated with the University of South Carolina and was hosted at the Universidad Veritas. As a public health major with a latin background, this program immediately caught my attention. I stayed with a host family for the duration of the program who opened me with open arms. My home was within walking distance from the Universidad to Veritas so I could easily walk to my two classes, Epidemiology and Global Health.</p>
               <p class="singapore-description-text">I enjoyed taking these courses in Costa Rica because I was able to see the public health topics we were discussing in action. For example, for Epidemiology I had the privilege of working with the Carlos Maria Ulloa nursing home in San Jose. As a class we visited the nursing home and helped them go through their medical records to create a database to track the most common diagnoses and conditions. We also interacted with the residents and played Bingo with them, which was my favorite part. I enjoyed learning Epidemiology this way because it was hands on and allowed me to see our work in action. Moreover, for my Global Health course we spent some time engaging in discussion in the classroom, but then immersed ourselves in the curriculum by visiting local clinics and healthcare facilities.</p>
               <p class="singapore-description-text">When I was not attending class I spent much time walking around the city and exploring San Jose. One day while walking downtown my friends and I even got to see a presidential inauguration, which amazed me because it was history in the making. Although the program mainly centered around San Jose, when we had longer breaks from class my friends and I would take the bus to explore other parts of Costa Rica. One weekend we took a bus to see the Volcano Irazu. The sheer vastness of the Volcano and surrounding area left me speechless. My favorite excursion was a full class excursion to Manuel Antonio on the central pacific coast of Costa Rica. We spent the weekend exploring the jungle full of monkeys and sloths, spent time swimming in the crisp ocean water, and even ziplining over the jungle. I am so grateful for the time I spent in this magnificent country and for the lifelong relationships I was able to form. From a young age, it had always been a goal of mine to study abroad, so Iâ€™m glad I got to pursue this dream in such a beautiful place.</p>
