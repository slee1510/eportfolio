            <!-- <p class="about-me-paragraph">Hi! My name is Alice and I am a senior studying mechanical engineering with a project management certificate at the University of Florida. Originally from Rome, Georgia my family moved to Jacksonville, Florida when I was 8 years old.</p>
            <p class="about-me-paragraph">My family is originally from Fujian, Fuzhou, China in a rural agricultural and fishing island region. Immigrating to America they had little education or resources; however, they made a home and family for themselves. I’m in awe of their resilience and success in a foreign country, as well as their commitment to new international experiences. They still love traveling and engraved that culture into my life as we have now traveled to 20 countries and 4 continents.</p>
            <p class="about-me-paragraph">In my free time I love to dance, play the guitar, and do puzzles! I also love to travel, try new hobbies, and new foods. My parents engraved an adventurous character into me, and I have loved to explore on my own during my college career. I have taken advantage of the university’s diverse culture and enjoyed learning more about my own and others!</p>
            <p class="about-me-paragraph">After graduation I plan to move to St. Louis, Missouri to pursue a career in consumer product manufacturing for a large international company. I love optimization and working with others to build capability and camaraderie. I hope to pursue a future in administrative and management positions.</p> -->
